The project illustrates a food delivery app, where the user can create an account and place an order, choose from a variety of restaurants, view their account and change account details. 
The application has three types of users: customer, delivery and administrator. The administrator has full rights.


Actions:
1. A visitor can create a new account and log in. There are three types of accounts: customer, deliverer and administrator. 
2. An administrator can delete customer or deliverer account for various reasons, such as canceling too many orders or making too many complaints
3. An administrator can add a deliverer and modify the deliverer's account. A deliverer has a car registration number, the main characteristic that makes him a deliverer.
4. The customer can see his profile. Only the customer has a delivery address where the food must be delivered.
5. A customer can change his profile. He can modify it depending on his current location.
6. The customer can choose from a variety of restaurants.
7. The customer can see a list of prices, info about dishes and options about delivery.
8. Only a customer can order from a restaurant. A deliverer can only deliver, as they can't place an order or make an account on their own, only if it's a customer account, separate from the deliverer account.
9. The customer can see their order in the history page.
10. A customer can add a restaurant to their favourite list.
